# Red Interactive- Dev Assessment - Alessio Falchi
This is my solution to the Red Interactive Dev Assessment. Is a simple application using [Vite-Express](https://github.com/szymmis/vite-express) with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/). On portrait devices the layout is the same as the image provided, on landscape devices I putted image and content on two columns. I used, as font, [Source Sans 3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3), which was the closest font to the one in the sample image that I could use self-hosted.

## Installation and Running
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
The application will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Running in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
